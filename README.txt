This is the CParts mod, introducing rocket parts based on the Chinese rocket CZ-1 (Long March 1). The parts can also be used to fill in some gaps in the stock parts, or have a new appearance on your rocket.

As of now, the mod only contains the DFH-1 Probe core and the solid engine 3rd stage. I've also finished the models and textures for the other two enines, but the two fuel tanks are not yet getting started.
