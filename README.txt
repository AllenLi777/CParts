This is the CParts mod, introducing rocket parts based on the Chinese rocket CZ-1 (Long March 1). This mod is a scaled-down and stock-balanced version of the real rocket. The parts can also be used to fill in some gaps in the stock parts, or have a new appearance on your rocket.

This mod has all its parts now, but the gimbal moduel of the two liquid fuel engines still require more work.
